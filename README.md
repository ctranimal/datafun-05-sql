# Ken McTran -- Exploratory SQL 

## Purposes
    The purpose of this repository  is to implement project 05 for SQL exploration

## Workflow:
    Repeatable workflows include the following:
    1. Follow best-practices for git-update-push to ensure workable code are regularly checked-in into cloud-based Github repository.
    2. python3 -m venv .venv  <!-- On Mac, this step create a local .venv directory to install tool into --> 
    ## On Mac, next 2 lines install needed tools (documented in requirements.txt ) into .venv environment
    3. python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    4. python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    5. 1. source .venv/bin/activate <!-- On Mac, this command would activate the environment -->
    6. At terminal, use the command "code ~/Repos/datafun-05-sql" to launch VS Code (previously installed on MAC) to open/edit/execute code related to this project.
